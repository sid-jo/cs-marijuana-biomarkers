# Tracking the High: Identifying the Best Biomarkers of Recent Marijuana Use

## Overview
As marijuana use becomes increasingly decriminalized across the U.S., addressing the legal and public health challenges, particularly driving under the influence of drugs (DUID), is critical for road safety. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of biomarkers for recent marijuana use to inform scientifically-grounded detection methods. By examining various cannabinoids (e.g. THC, CBN, CBD, etc.) across biological matrices such as blood, breath, and oral fluid, the study aims to identify the most effective biomarker and optimal cutoff levels for detecting recent use.

## Key Contributions
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using standard R packages. Examined different dimensions of the data from patient

**Data Analysis:** Employed advanced sensitivity/specificity analysis to identify the most relevant biomarkers for distinguishing recent use. Assessed the reliability of each combination of biomarkers, cutoffs, and matrices at various time windows from the study.

**Research Summaries:** Documented findings in a comprehensive report, detailing methodologies, results, and future research directions. Created infographic to summarize findings in an accessible format.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming:** R
- **Data Analysis:** tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr)
- **Data Visualization:** ggplot2, cowplot, Adobe Photoshop
- **Statistical Modeling:** rstatix

## Objectives  
1. Analyze various cannabinoids across biological matrices (blood, breath, oral fluid) to determine the most selective biomarkers for detecting recent marijuana use.
2. Define appropriate cutoff levels for biomarkers that strike the balance between maximizing road safety and minimizing wrongful convictions.
3. Generate scientifically grounded insights to guide the development of fair laws related to DUIDs.
4. Discuss limitations, including dataset scope and potential confounders, and suggested avenues for further research

## Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of biomarkers for recent marijuana use, identifying the most effective compounds and cutoff levels across various biological matrices. By balancing selectivity and sensitivity, the findings aim to support the development of accurate and scientifically grounded methods for detecting impairment. These insights have practical applications in law enforcement and medical diagnostics, contributing to public safety and informing future legislation on DUIDs.
